# rock-paper-scissors

Odin project's rock-paper-scissors project for my first javascript implementations.
This particular project mainly focus on the logic behind a simple rock paper scissors game.

Total game would be 5 rounds, and whoever (player and computer), have the most points
after 5 rounds, will emerge victorious. It will be a draw if both have the same number of points
or are tied throughout the 5 rounds.
